This file exists as a marker to let Jenkins/rpc-gating know that adding config overrides for gating and
scenarios will be handled in repo and doesn't need to be touched by gating scripts.


Once this has been backported to all branches, the functionality will be removed from rpc-gating, then these
files won't be needed.
